# Meili UI

A super lightweight User Iinterface for Meilisearch.

## Goals

The plan is to build out a UI to not only perform searches, but also manage Meilisearch instances.

- [x] List & Search indexes
- [ ] Connect to multiple instances
- [ ] Manage Keys & permissions
- [ ] Manage Index settings
- [ ] Monitor tasks
- [ ] Create snapshots

Contributions are most welcome.

## Install

There is nothing fancy here, no build steps, just simple HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Clone the repo onto your server:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tobz-nz/meili-ui.git /path-to-public-folder
```

Then open it in your browser:

```bash
open https://your-site.example/meili-ui
```

## Why

I started this project for 2 reasons:

1. The UI that runs on Meilisearch is VERY basic.
2. I've been wanting to experiment with native Web Components for a few years, and now seems to be the time.

Yeah, yeah - I'm using the small [Web Component Base](https://github.com/ayoayco/web-component-base) library so I don't have to muck about with WC boilerplates. So what?
I have done that stuff and TBH, I can't be bothered. Web Component Base is really quite nice, so stuff you guys :laughing:
